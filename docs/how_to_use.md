# layout-oriented replacement mode

Click the icon ![icon24.png](https://github.com/T3aHat/DeepLopener/raw/main/icon24.png) in the right-hand corner and
move the cursor and right-click to select the text you want to translate or click to cancel to select.  
![layout-oriented.gif](https://github.com/T3aHat/DeepLopener/raw/main/images/layout-oriented.gif)  
The selected frame will be translated on layout-oriented replacement mode keeping the original style.  
If you click the icon ![icon24.png](https://github.com/T3aHat/DeepLopener/raw/main/icon24.png) in the right-hand corner and

# PDF mode

On PDF, select the text you want to translate and right-click on the text and click on `DeepL:selected_text`.  
![pdfmode.gif](https://github.com/T3aHat/DeepLopener/raw/main/images/pdfmode.gif)  
For sites whose MIME type is `application/pdf` (local PDF files available!), the `transition mode` changes to `PDF mode` and the other modes are disabled.  
You can move the translation frame around freely in Drag-and-Drop, and right-clicking on the translation result frame will remove it.

- Can't use PDF mode on local PDF files?  
  Ensure that the "Allow access to file URLs" is checked on options page of this extension like below.

# text-oriented replacement mode

With the text to be translated selected, press `Ctrl+X` (`⌘+X` on mac) twice within 1 second or click on the icon ![icno24.png](https://github.com/T3aHat/DeepLopener/raw/main/icon24.png) that appears after selecting the text.  
![text-oriented.gif](https://github.com/T3aHat/DeepLopener/raw/main/images/text-oriented.gif)  
The selected text is highlighted in red first. After traslation , it turns yellow.  
Right-click on the translation to display the original text.If you do it again, the letters will be toggled back to translation.  
It is recommended to use this mode separately from the layout-oriented replacement mode because the original layout will be destroyed.

# transition mode

Right click on the text you want to translate → Click on `DeepL:selected_text`.
